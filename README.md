Notice:

1. Please do not not use SFU email for registration, you will not receive the confirmation email.

2. Since we do not have our own domain service the urls are based on localhost:8080, it could be changed if we got actual server rather than the vagrant VM.

3. Since Google map API does not allow retrive data too many times in short time. Some of the locations at end of the initial data might not get the data.

4. More instructions for how to use this app can be found at the help page.
